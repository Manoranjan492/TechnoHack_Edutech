<h2>Description:</h2>
->"Rock-paper-scissors" is a simple hand game that is played between two people. The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.</br></br>

->The game is often used as a simple decision-making tool between two people, where each person selects one of the three shapes with their hand. The game's simplicity and quick results make it a popular choice for resolving disputes or making simple choices.

<h3>Here's a breakdown of the three possible choices:</h3>
<b>1.Rock:</b> Represented by making a fist. It defeats scissors (rock crushes scissors) but is defeated by paper (paper covers rock).</br>
<b>2.Paper:</b> Represented by an open hand. It defeats rock (paper covers rock) but is defeated by scissors (scissors cuts paper).</br>
<b>3.Scissors:</b> Represented by extending the index and middle fingers in a V shape. It defeats paper (scissors cuts paper) but is defeated by rock (rock crushes scissors).</br>
</br>
The game has a circular and balanced nature, with each choice winning against one option and losing against another. It's often used as a random decision-making game or as a fun and quick activity.
</br>
Players usually count to three in unison before simultaneously forming one of the three shapes with their hand. The winner of the round is determined based on the rules mentioned above. The game can be played in a single round or in a best-of series with an odd number of rounds to avoid ties. It's a classic game that is known and played by people of all ages around the world.
